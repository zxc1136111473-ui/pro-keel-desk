/**
 * Every desktop plugin the composed profile mounts has to be reachable from
 * the profile directory, and the profile does not resolve through the app's
 * own node_modules.
 *
 * Harness mirrors the dependency closure of `@deepseek-ai/dsh` into
 * `$DSH_HOME/profiles/node_modules`, anchored at that package's manifest — not
 * at ours. A desktop plugin therefore reaches the profile only by being
 * injected into that manifest's dependencies, which is what the `dsh` patch
 * does. Adding a row to the profile patch without that injection boots to
 * `Cannot find package ... imported from .../profiles/web/`, which fails the
 * whole plugin tree rather than just that row.
