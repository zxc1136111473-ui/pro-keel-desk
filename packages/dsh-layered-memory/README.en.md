# dsh-layered-memory

**A layered distillation memory plugin for DeepSeek Harness: conversations are processed in the background through L0 capture → L1 atomic memories → L2 scene consolidation → L3 persona distillation, and relevant memories are automatically injected into context before every model step — neither the user nor the model needs to do anything.**

## Getting Started

Requires Node ≥ 22.16 and DeepSeek Harness ≥ **0.1.2-alpha.1** (as of 0.8.12 only the
0.1.2-alpha.x host line is supported; for older hosts see the
[release history](https://github.com/JunNanLYS/dsh-layered-memory/releases)).
Two invocation styles — the `npx` prefix can replace `dsh` in
any command below:

```bash
# Option 1: run the official CLI directly via npx (no pre-installed dsh; the host version must
# be pinned to the alpha line — the npm "latest" tag still points to 0.1.1-rc.x)
npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-alpha.2 plugin --profile web add dsh-layered-memory

# Option 2: with the dsh CLI installed (upgrade to the alpha line first:
# npm i -g @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-alpha.2, then restart; dsh is a pnpm forwarder —
# npm i -g pnpm first if missing)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-layered-memory

# Alternative sources: GitHub repo / local path (dev & debugging, link: points at the repo; npm run build + restart dsh to apply)
dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/JunNanLYS/dsh-layered-memory
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-layered-memory
```

### Install via an AI Agent (Recommended)

If your current agent can run terminal commands, send it this message as-is:

```text
Please install the dsh-layered-memory plugin for the web profile of DeepSeek Harness.

Run only the two commands below and do not modify any other profile:
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-layered-memory
dsh --profile web --dump-config

Confirm that dsh-layered-memory appears in the output, then report the result to me.
Do not close or restart my running DSH yourself; after installation, remind me to manually restart the DSH Web Host.
```

The agent should report the installation result and explicitly tell you whether
`dsh-layered-memory` has appeared in the configuration.

This package declares a `dsh.bundle` composition layer (`cordis.patch.yml`); after
installation the **plugin entry is mounted automatically** — no need to hand-edit
`$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`. Then restart DeepSeek Harness and verify:
the appearance of `conversations/ records/ scenes/` and `memory.db` under
`~/.dsh/memory/` means the plugin applied successfully; the "Memory" page in settings (the Memory Workspace with five zones)
and the memory chip in the input bar (`Memory · Auto`) mean the client half is ready.

> ⚠️ **Security note**: installing a plugin = running third-party code with your
> privileges. This plugin reads session content, writes files in its data directory,
> and calls the LLM/embedding services you configured; if that concerns you, review
> the source first (`src/`).

**Uninstall**: `dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-layered-memory` + restart. Data
stays in `~/.dsh/memory/`; delete the whole directory manually if you don't need it.

### Development from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JunNanLYS/dsh-layered-memory
cd dsh-layered-memory
npm install && npm run build
dsh plugin --profile web add .        # link: install; after code changes, npm run build + restart dsh
npm run smoke                         # smoke test (rebuild first: see command below)
npx tsc src/smoke.ts --outDir dist-smoke --module nodenext --moduleResolution nodenext --target es2022 --strict --skipLibCheck --esModuleInterop
```

## Runtime Data Flow

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/readme/flow.svg" width="100%"
       alt="Runtime data flow: session events from User and Assistant (left) flow into the plugin (L0 capture, L1–L3 distillation, retrieval, memory tools), which injects relevant memories into the DeepSeek Harness core (right) at agent/pre-step; distillation reuses the core's ctx.llm and data is dual-written to ~/.dsh/memory/">
</p>

The plugin attaches to DSH-native event seams (`session/event` for capture,
`agent/pre-step` for injection) and reuses the host's `ctx.llm` for distillation. Recall
is presented as **message-side injection**: relevant memories enter the conversation as a
synthetic message placed right before the user's new message, rendered as a
**"Context injection · memory"** row in the chat flow (expand to see the hits) — so you
can see "memory at work" directly. Injected content is bounded by length and
time budgets — oversized lines are truncated (pointing the model at the memory tools for
the full text) and a timed-out recall silently skips that turn, never slowing the chat.
**Per-session dedupe**: a memory already injected in this session is not injected again
(the model's context already holds it — follow-up questions on the same topic save
tokens); the record resets when the context is compacted or cleared, so memories can
flow back in, and an updated memory (new id after a content change) is never held back
by the old suppression. **Freshness weighting**: recall ranking applies a soft weight
`relevance × max(0.5, 0.5^(days since last update / 30))` — among candidates of similar
relevance the fresh one wins (slots rotate naturally), while a strongly relevant old
memory still recalls fine (the floor caps its loss at half a ranking score, so
long-lived facts never sink); tune via `recall.decayHalfLifeDays`, `0` disables. It
also registers three model-callable memory tools: `memory_search` /
`conversation_search` / `memory_read_scene`.

**Cost dashboard**: every distillation LLM call (extract / dedup / L2 / L3) writes its
token cost to a SQLite detail table keyed by `provider/model` (configurable retention,
default 365 days with rolling cleanup on write; accounting failures only log a warning
and never block distillation). Visualize it under Settings → Memory → Insights → the **Cost** sub-page:
per-model trend lines (day/week/month granularity + last-N-days window + L1/L2/L3 layer
filter), a layer × time-window table (calls / output & reasoning tokens / mean / median),
and per-model totals — distillation overhead at a glance. Input is counted in characters
(DSH streaming usage carries no input tokens); output and reasoning in tokens.

In action: the "Context injection · memory" row surfaces relevant memories first, and
the model then calls `memory_read_scene` directly to read scene blocks before answering
from memory:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/img/MemoryTools.png" width="60%"
       alt="Real conversation UI (light theme): a "Context injection · memory" row sits above the user's message asking about recent plans; the assistant lists 4 memory_read_scene tool calls (with scene-block .md filenames as arguments) before answering from memory">
</p>

In restricted sessions where only the code-execution entry point is available, the model
reaches the memory tools indirectly through `run_code` (nested as SUBTOOL calls in the
trajectory view):

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/img/ToolTrajectory.png" width="80%"
       alt="Tool-call trajectory view: a colored timeline on top and a step list on the left (SYSTEM/CONTEXT/USER/ASSISTANT/TOOL/SUBTOOL tags); a run_code tool step nests 5 memory_read_scene sub-tool calls (SUBTOOL tags), with a detail panel for the selected step on the right">
</p>

## Layered Memory (L0–L3)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/img/Layers.png" width="100%"
       alt="Four memory layers refining from top-left to bottom-right: L0 raw conversation (chat bubbles) → L1 atomic memories (glowing fact particles) → L2 scene blocks (glass document slabs) → L3 core persona (radiant crystal core); stages connected by LLM extract/consolidate/distill light beams, shrinking width shows progressive refinement">
</p>

## Per-Session Memory Modes

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/img/MemoryChip.png" width="72%"
       alt="Session memory chip and cascade menu in dark theme: in the composer-left cluster, right of the Read Only chip sits the "Memory · Auto ▾" chip; clicking opens a rounded popover menu upward with two rows "Memory scope  Auto ›" / "Data flow  Follow global ›", and hovering the data-flow row reveals a secondary panel listing Follow global ✓ / Read & write / Write only / Paused">
</p>

The conversation side is a **distributed memory surface** — each kind of information
lives in the native host seat designed for it; the plugin no longer owns a strip:

- **Memory chip** (composer-left cluster, right of the Read Only chip): a borderless
  `Memory · {Auto|Personal|Work}` chip in official composer-chip grammar; the text is
  the resolved truth — `Memory · write-only` (injection off), `Memory · paused`
  (gray dot), `Memory · degraded` (amber dot); zh/en bilingual, following the host
  language.
- **Cascade menu** (click the chip, opens upward): two rows, `Memory scope {value} ›`
  and `Data flow {value} ›`; data-flow options live in a **hover-only secondary
  panel** (Follow global / Read & write / Write only / Paused) — no click-pinning,
  with bridge hot-zones so slow mouse travel never breaks the hover chain; full
  keyboard path (arrow-key roving + focus reveal).
- **Inline slider** (click "Memory scope", grows in place): three stops
  Personal / Work / Auto; crossing a stop updates the chip text **live** while
  dragging; keyboard arrows/Home/End + `aria-valuetext`.
- **Pause-resume snapshot**: switching the data flow to "Paused" enters the off mode
  and persists the pre-pause scope and injection override; resuming restores them
  as-is. Per-session choices persist to `session-modes.json` (stacked with the
  global switches — global is the master gate); L2/L3 are fully family-isolated.
- **Memory occupancy lives only in the official context meter panel**: opening the
  official ring shows the "Memory" section (recall snippets / memory stable zone);
  the composer area has zero occupancy UI — only a `N pending distill` telemetry
  segment appended to the official stats line.
- **Write-only sessions (#38)**: pick "Write only" in the data-flow panel for a
  **write-only session** — capture and distillation continue as usual (conversation
  still settles into L0→L1→L2/L3), but nothing is injected into this session (recall
  injection, the persona/navigation stable section and the tools guide all stop;
  `memory_search` and the other read tools return a write-only notice). The override
  persists per session; switching back to "Follow global" clears it to the recall
  toggle in Automation. Ideal for debug/eval/sensitive sessions that should absorb
  without interference. Orthogonal to Paused: paused is full stealth (capture off
  too), while write-only keeps the "in" and gates the "out".

## UI Preview

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/img/ui-dark.png" width="49.5%"
       alt="Memory Workspace overview in dark theme: five-zone task nav (Overview selected), health summary card (running normally + storage/vector/distill-queue subsystem chips + a pending-distill attention chip), recent-activity list (New/Updated verb tags + Memory/Scene kind tags + relative times), key-number tiles (memories / scenes / weekly distill output / last distill) and jump buttons to the other zones">
  <img src="./assets/img/ui-light.png" width="49.5%"
       alt="The same Memory Workspace overview in light theme: identical five-zone nav and health/activity/numbers layout on light card backgrounds with the same accent family, theme switch without reload">
</p>

Settings → Memory is the **Memory Workspace** (five-zone task nav, sticky tabs +
arrow-key roving):

- **Overview**: health summary + recent activity + key numbers + a guided empty state;
- **Library**: a **read-only asset activity feed** with L1 memories / L2 scenes /
  L3 personas mixed by update time (search + type/scope/time filters + in-place
  expansion + copy);
- **Automation**: basic switches + advanced disclosure (distill route chains and
  budgets) + embedding-model disclosure;
- **Insights**: Cost / Activity (7-day asset activity + distill calls & failures) /
  Recall (cumulative totals + disabled distribution);
- **Maintenance**: runtime health + diagnostic log + the danger-zone full rebuild
  (confirm modal + progress + cancellable).

## Measured Comparison (DSH-MemBench: Automated Benchmark)

Screenshots show what the plugin looks like — this section answers "**what does enabling it actually buy you?**" with measured numbers from an **automated benchmark** ([`bench/`](./bench/), one command to reproduce). Method: the same scenario bank with verbatim-identical inputs runs in **Group A (memory on)** with 3 merged repetitions and **Group B (memory off)** with 1 repetition (a memory-off long task burns multiples of the tokens per scenario — a cost guardrail); the dialog track now runs Group A only (memory-off probes in independent sessions cannot succeed, so the control carries no information — retired). Dialog-track environment: DeepSeek official `deepseek-v4-flash`, plugin 0.8.5 (judge same-source as tested; every answer archived for manual audit), Windows; taxonomy adapted from [LongMemEval](https://github.com/xiaowu0162/longmemeval) / [LoCoMo](https://snap-research.github.io/locomo/) / [AMB](https://github.com/vectorize-io/agent-memory-benchmark), with the extended probe types and lifecycle track informed by [MemoryAgentBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05257) / [GoodAI LTM](https://github.com/GoodAI/goodai-ltm-benchmark) / BEAM.

> The dialog track below is the **fresh 0.8.5 baseline** (fixed plugin + corrected judging criteria); the workflow-track numbers remain the archived 0.8.3 run (the bank has since grown to 8 scenarios with a prospective-memory addition — re-run pending).

### Dialog track (20 scenarios × 10 probe types × 3 reps = 420 questions): does it remember correctly

> 0.8.5 baseline (Group A data; the dialog-track B arm is retired — Group A only).

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/readme/bench-dialog.svg" width="100%"
       alt="DSH-MemBench dialog track accuracy chart (Group A, memory on): overall accuracy 95.2% (400/420); six core probe types, 60 questions each — extraction 58/60, multi-hop 60/60, temporal 56/60, updates 55/60, scene recall 52/60, abstention 60/60 with 0 fabricated; four extended probe types, 15 each — accretive completion 15/15, update chains 15/15, event ordering 14/15, paraphrase 15/15">
</p>

**Dual-channel recall** (Group A): passive injection hit rate **78.1%** (the answer's key points appear in the recall injection, 281/360); most of the rest the model recovered by **actively calling the memory tools** — 106 questions with active queries, **75 rescued by tools**. The end-to-end 95.2% is the composite of both channels plus model utilization. With the memory store accumulating across scenarios for the whole run, 295 probe injections carried other scenarios' memories (honestly counted) — yet accuracy actually *rose* from 92.8% (early, small store) to 97.7% (late, largest store), and offline flooding with 600 extra synthetic records moved retrieval recall@5 by only −2.8pp: interference resistance under a growing store, measured.

**Layered weaknesses**: offline retrieval metrics (recall@5, controlled replay) total 73.3%, with event ordering at 0% and scene recall at 50% — end-to-end still 93%+ thanks to model robustness over adjacent injected memories. **Efficiency triangle** (the cost of memory): injections add no latency (injected turns respond 210ms *faster* on average), recall text is ~10.3% of per-turn input, and the whole distillation pipeline costs ≈2727 input / 240 output tokens per captured message (1172 calls, 0 failures).

### Workflow track (archived 0.8.3 · 7-scenario edition · Group A ×3 / Group B ×1, real tool sandbox): does it do it right, and cheaper

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/readme/bench-workflow.svg" width="100%"
       alt="DSH-MemBench workflow track, Group A vs Group B: probe-phase completion A 59/69 (85.5%) vs B 10/23 (43.5%); cost comparison (Group B as the full-bar baseline, per-scenario means) — steps 24.3 vs 41.4 (B +70%), tool calls 37.7 vs 62.1 (B +65%), input tokens 266k vs 1.81M (B 6.8×); style-convention scenario probes A 12/12 vs B 0/4; long-task input tokens per scenario A 266k vs B 1.81M">
</p>

**Probe-phase completion 85.5% vs 43.5% (+42pp)**: both groups have live context during teach/change phases — the probe phase (continuation task in a fresh session) is the pure memory window. Group A scored a perfect 12/12 on all three new probe archetypes (workflow knowledge update / twin-runbook disambiguation / style-convention continuity), consistent across all three reps; Group B scored **0/4** on style-convention probes (naming/structure/thousands-separator/footer conventions exist only in memory — they cannot be explored out of the sandbox), while on the workflow-update scenario it can reverse-engineer the procedure by reading the script (discrimination limited by sandbox affordances, honestly noted).

**Long-task cost: Group B burns 6.8× Group A's input tokens per scenario** (1.81M vs 266k) — without memory the agent advances by re-exploring, and under a high reasoning effort it even builds its own projects to probe what a one-line script convention would have done; output tokens 3× (46.2k vs 15.4k), steps +70%. This is memory's core value: **what it saves is not task difficulty, but pointless round-trips and re-exploration**.

### Methodology & reproduction

```bash
node bench/harness/run.mjs --arm A --repeats 3 --provider deepseek-official --model deepseek-v4-flash   # dialog track (Group A only)
node bench/harness/run.mjs --track workflow --arm AB --repeats 3 ...                                  # workflow track (A/B arms in parallel)
node bench/harness/run.mjs --track lifecycle --arm A ...                                              # lifecycle track (gating/off/rebuild/forget)
node bench/harness/report.mjs --latest [dialog|workflow]                                               # aggregate report
node bench/harness/retrieval-metrics.mjs <runDir> --flood 200,600                                     # retrieval metrics + flooding curve
```

- Scoring: programmatic `contains-all` plus an LLM judge against key points (every answer and verdict is preserved in `result.json` for human audit); for stale-bearing probes (updates/update-chains/forget) an old value only fails when stated *as the current answer*, and abstention probes allow citing real adjacent facts while denying the asked point; workflow completion is verified programmatically from produced files and their contents (four check kinds: positive / forbidden-word / must-not-exist / exists);
- Metric surface: beyond the per-type accuracy table (6 core + 4 extended types), reports automatically include **offline retrieval metrics** (recall@5 / injection precision / stale leakage), the **efficiency triangle** (injection latency differential / injection share / distillation accounting per captured message), **scale-position analysis** (accuracy & contamination vs store growth), and the lifecycle-track section (family-gating matrix / off-mode dual assertions / rebuild fidelity / forget requests);
- Live progress: running the benchmark auto-starts a local progress panel and opens the browser (`--no-panel` to disable) — per-arm scenario/phase/message-level progress, heartbeat & activity freshness (distinguishes "stuck" from "process died"), and cumulative cost as it accrues;
- Metrics come from provider-reported usage (input with cache-hit split) and session-event folding; the steady-state cache rate excludes each session's first request (0.8.5 baseline: 89.1% — memory injection does not hurt caching);
- Regression use: run before/after a plugin change and diff with `compare.mjs` (environment header check including git SHA + Group-B control-drift warning + retrieval-metric comparison);
- Limitations (stated honestly): single machine; Group A ×3 merged, Group B ×1 (cost guardrail — noisier); judge vs tested model: same model in the 0.8.5 dialog baseline, heterogeneous in the archived workflow run (glm-5.3 judging v4-flash); the scenario bank is author-built (biased toward memory-advantage scenarios — reproduce it yourself); sandbox-file affordances partially leak procedures (Group B can reverse-engineer by reading scripts — discrimination limits honestly noted); dual-tier tool audit (strict violation voids the scenario / loose heuristic flags only), with 0 violations measured on both sides.

Full reports and per-question data: [`bench/baseline/`](./bench/baseline/).

## Configuration

Override configs go into the profile's own `cordis.patch.yml` as a **top-level bare
patch entry** (direct `id:`, not wrapped in `insert:` — an insert with the same id as
the bundle layer appends and causes `duplicate loader entry id` startup failure):

```yaml
- id: dsh-memory
  name: dsh-layered-memory
  config:                    # keys replace whole lines (no deep merge); write out all keys you want to keep
    family: auto             # default mode for new sessions: auto | chat | work
    llm:                     # static distillation route (both fields set = deployment pin,
      provider: ''           # which outranks the settings-page route chain; when empty the route
      model: ''              # follows the route-chain primary row in the settings page or the default model)
```

| Field | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `family` | `auto` | Default memory mode for new sessions: `auto` (both families) \| `chat` (personal) \| `work` (work); switchable per session via the input-bar control |
| `dataDir` | `$DSH_HOME/memory` | Data directory |
| `capture.enabled` | `true` | L0 capture |
| `capture.stripCodeBlocks` | `true` | Strip code blocks from assistant messages |
| `capture.maxMessageChars` | `4000` | Max characters per message |
| `extract.enabled` | `true` | L1 extraction |
| `extract.minMessages` | `6` | Steady-state trigger threshold: run L1 extraction once a session accumulates N new messages. The effective threshold ramps up 1→2→4→…→N (first turn yields memories immediately, then batches to save calls) |
| `extract.idleSeconds` | `300` | Idle flush: distill a session's pending slice after N seconds of silence (catches "user left before reaching the threshold"); `0` disables |
| `extract.backgroundMessages` | `10` | Background messages attached to extraction (fetched per session from L0 — no cross-session contamination) |
| `extract.candidatePool` | `5` | Dedup candidate pool size |
| `l2.enabled` | `true` | L2 scene consolidation |
| `l2.minNewMemories` | `5` | New-memory threshold since last L2 consolidation |
| `l2.maxScenes` | `12` | Scene block count cap |
| `l2.sceneContextLimit` | `3` | Max similar-scene full texts attached to the L2 prompt |
| `l3.enabled` | `true` | L3 persona distillation |
| `l3.interval` | `20` | L3 distillation interval (new-memory count) |
| `recall.enabled` | `true` | Auto recall |
| `recall.maxResults` | `5` | Max L1 records injected before each new user message |
| `recall.maxCharsPerMemory` | `500` | Per-memory character cap for injected recall (overlong lines truncated with a hint to use the memory tools for the full text); `0` disables |
| `recall.maxTotalRecallChars` | `2000` | Total character cap per injected recall batch (lowest-ranked tail dropped first); `0` disables |
| `recall.timeoutMs` | `5000` | Overall recall budget (ms): a timed-out recall skips that turn without blocking the chat; `0` disables |
| `recall.includePersona` | `true` | Inject persona context into the system prompt (`<user-persona>`, stable zone) |
| `recall.includeSceneNav` | `true` | Inject scene navigation into the system prompt (`<scene-navigation>`, stable zone) |
| `recall.strategy` | `hybrid` | Retrieval strategy: `keyword` / `embedding` / `hybrid` |
| `recall.scoreThreshold` | `0.3` | Recall score threshold (below is not injected; applies to keyword/embedding only, not pre-fusion hybrid; tool path unfiltered) |
| `recall.decayHalfLifeDays` | `30` | Freshness-decay half-life for recall ranking (days, 0=off): ranking applies `relevance × max(0.5, 0.5^(days since last update / half-life))` — among similarly relevant candidates the fresh one wins (slots rotate), and an old memory loses at most half its ranking score (floor keeps long-lived facts afloat) |
| `embedding.enabled` | `false` | Vector retrieval switch; off = pure FTS |
| `embedding.baseUrl` | empty | OpenAI-compatible /embeddings endpoint (e.g. `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1`) |
| `embedding.apiKey` | empty | API key |
| `embedding.model` | empty | embedding model name |
| `embedding.dimensions` | `0` | Vector dimensions (required when enabled; must match model output) |
| `embedding.maxInputChars` | `5000` | Max characters per text (overlong inputs truncated) |
| `embedding.timeoutMs` | `10000` | Per-call embedding timeout (ms) |
| `embedding.allowLocalModels` | `true` | Allow the local embedding tier (deployment ceiling; when off, no model downloads and no local tier in settings) |
| `embedding.mirror` | `https://hf-mirror.com` | Download mirror root for local models (can be changed back to `https://huggingface.co`) |
| `embedding.proxy` | `''` | Three-state download proxy: `''` (default) = auto-detect proxy env vars (`HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` etc., honoring `NO_PROXY`); `none` = disable, always direct; any other value = proxy URL (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:7890`). Direct connections to the mirror are intermittently unreachable on some networks (connect timeouts and poisoned bytes have both been observed) — keep the default auto-detection on machines with a proxy |
| `llm.provider/model` | empty | Static distillation route (deployment pin): when **both** fields are set the route is locked, outranking the settings-page runtime route chain and the default model (deployments can force distillation onto a specific route); when empty the route follows "settings-page route-chain primary → default model". At runtime, configure the primary route and fallback chain in the **route-chain editor** under Settings → Memory → Automation → Advanced routing and budgets (pick from **configured providers**, including custom ones added in dsh Settings → Models; the primary row may stay empty to follow the default model) — a non-empty chain takes over this static config wholesale, effective immediately with no restart |
| `llm.fallbacks` | `[]` | Distillation fallback chain: an ordered list of backup routes tried one by one when the primary route fails (error / cut-off / network error / **empty output**); each entry is `{provider, model, reasoningEffort?}` (a non-empty effort overrides the global `llm.reasoningEffort`, still clamped by model capability); entries identical to the primary route are skipped; **each route gets the full `timeoutMs`**; when all routes fail, the existing per-session backoff takes over. Empty list (default) = single-route behavior unchanged (see [Distillation fallback chain & slow-TTFT models](#distillation-fallback-chain--slow-ttft-models) below); a non-empty settings-page runtime chain (`distillChain`) takes over **both** the primary route and the fallback chain (a single-row chain = explicitly no fallbacks), empty = follow this config |
| `llm.layerRoutes` | `{}` | **Per-layer distillation routing** (#34): keys `l1`/`l2`/`l3`, each holding a **complete chain** (entries like `llm.fallbacks`, **head row must have both provider+model explicitly**). A non-empty chain **fully replaces** that layer's resolution (its primary and fallbacks all come from the layer chain; the global chain no longer participates); empty/missing = the layer follows the global chain. `l1` covers both extraction and dedup call sites. Layers can also be edited at runtime in the segmented panel under distillation parameters on the settings page (takes priority over this static config); a deployment pin does not disable static layer chains (same deployer-owned config as the fallback-chain precedent). Orthogonal to and composable with the fallback chain — one complete chain per layer (ADR-0005) |
| `llm.maxTokens` | `65536` | Fallback output cap for non-layered calls. Each distillation stage has its own budget (extraction 16k / dedup 8k / L2 32k / L3 16k; auto ×4 when the reasoning effort is high/xhigh/max, so thinking can't starve the text budget); the per-layer budgets are runtime-adjustable in Settings → Memory → Automation → Advanced routing and budgets (empty/0 = built-in defaults) |
| `llm.reasoningEffort` | empty | Distillation reasoning effort: empty = **auto** (resolved from model capability: the model's default tier, else `high`); an explicit value (`off`/`none`/`minimal`/`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`) is only sent when the model declares support — effort vocabularies differ across providers (deepseek accepts `off`, OpenAI-style APIs use `none`, models that declare no tiers get nothing), and unsupported tiers degrade to not-sending with a one-time warning; output budgets auto-×4 at high/xhigh/max. At runtime, override the effort **per route** in the settings-page route-chain editor (per-row dropdown; the tier list follows each model's declared capability live, defaulting to this value) |
| `llm.temperature` | `0.3` | Distillation temperature |
| `llm.maxInputChars` | `700000` | Input character budget per distillation call (over-budget L1 inputs are chunked automatically); runtime-adjustable in Settings → Memory → Automation → Advanced routing and budgets → input budget (empty/0 = follow this value) |
| `llm.timeoutMs` | `120000` | Per-call distillation timeout (ms) |
| `tokenCost.retentionDays` | `365` | Retention (days) for distillation cost details (the `token_cost` table); rows older than this are rolled away on write. `0` = keep forever. Also the upper bound of the cost dashboard's "last N days" window |
| `tools` | `true` | Whether to register model-callable memory tools |
| `benchControl` | `false` | Register the in-process bench control service (rebuild trigger / session-mode setting / distillation usage snapshot — used by the benchmark's lifecycle track). Off by default — zero surface in production deployments; do not enable casually |

### Distillation fallback chain & slow-TTFT models

Free/slow tiers of some inference providers have **first-token latencies (TTFT) upwards of 20 seconds**, while some upstream gateways cut a silent connection at ~20s — distillation calls then fail at a fixed ~20s (`llm aborted`) long before the plugin's 120s timeout could ever matter (the scenario measured in [#31](https://github.com/JunNanLYS/dsh-layered-memory/issues/31)). Three mitigations, pick as needed:

1. **Switch route** (most direct): change the primary route live in the route-chain editor under Settings → Memory → Automation → Advanced routing and budgets (or move a fast route to the head of the chain), or pin `llm.provider`/`llm.model` statically.
2. **Fallback chain** (automatic demotion): when the primary route fails, backup routes are tried in order with no manual intervention:

   ```yaml
   llm:
     provider: opencode-go          # primary route (may be left unpinned: settings-page route-chain primary / default model)
     model: ox-alpha-free
     fallbacks:                     # entry order = demotion priority; unset = single-route behavior unchanged
       - provider: opencode-go
         model: deepseek-v4-flash
         reasoningEffort: low       # optional: per-route effort override (defaults to the global value)
       - provider: deepseek-official
         model: deepseek-v4-flash
   ```

3. **Per-layer routing** (each layer on its own channel): distillation layers want different things from a model (L1 is high-frequency and wants cheap/fast/stable; L3 tolerates slow first packets but needs strong capability), so diverging layers can get their own chain — one **complete fallback chain per layer**, while unconfigured layers keep using the global chain:

   ```yaml
   llm:
     layerRoutes:                  # per-layer routing (#34); the head row must set provider+model explicitly
       l1:                         # l1 covers both extraction and dedup call sites: a cheap, fast, stable chain
         - provider: opencode-go
           model: deepseek-v4-flash
           reasoningEffort: low
         - provider: deepseek-official   # in-layer fallback: L1 failures demote only here, never onto the global chain
           model: deepseek-v4-flash
       l3:                         # L3 persona distillation: low frequency, large inputs — a strong-capability chain
         - provider: deepseek-official
           model: deepseek-v4-flash
           reasoningEffort: high
   ```

   Layers can also be edited at runtime in the **segmented panel** (global default / L1 / L2 / L3) under Settings → Memory → Automation → Advanced routing and budgets. In-layer priority: runtime layer chain > this static YAML layer chain > global default chain, falling back level by level.

   Failure = error / cut-off / network error / **empty output** (stream ends normally with 0 characters — worthless for distillation since parsing always fails, so it is treated as a route failure rather than an empty return); caller-initiated cancellation does not demote; each route gets the **full** `llm.timeoutMs` (a shared budget would give a slow-TTFT fallback route less time than its real first-packet needs, defeating the chain); token costs are recorded per attempt (failed attempts get a row too, with whatever tokens arrived before the stream broke), and successful calls are attributed to the route that actually served. The route chain can also be adjusted at runtime in the route-chain editor under Settings → Memory → Automation → Advanced routing and budgets (no config edit or restart needed); the YAML below suits deployments that want to pin the static chain.
4. **Raise the timeout**: `llm.timeoutMs` only helps when the route is genuinely slow but the gateway doesn't cut; if the gateway kills at 20s, raising the plugin timeout is futile — use the first two layers.

## Storage Layout

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/readme/storage.svg" width="100%"
       alt="Storage layout: dual-write architecture (append-only JSONL source of truth + memory.db retrieval engine); file forms include conversations/records/scenes/persona/state/pending/session-modes/embedding-source/model catalog/inference runtime/log and rebuild archives; three retrieval strategies keyword/embedding/hybrid (RRF k=60); a degradation chain never blocks the host">
</p>

Vectors are off by default (pure FTS). DSH's `ctx.llm` has no embeddings endpoint;
semantic retrieval is provided by a **three-state embedding source** (off / remote /
local), switchable at runtime in the settings page — see the next section.

## Semantic Retrieval (Embedding Source)

Pick the embedding source in Settings → Memory → Automation → embedding models;
it takes effect immediately, no config edit or restart:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/img/EmbeddingSource.png" width="70%"
       alt="Semantic retrieval (embedding source) panel in the settings page (light theme): a three-state selector (Off/Local/Remote, Local selected) showing the current source and the first-run runtime install hint; below it the local model catalog lists BGE small Chinese (in use/ready), EmbeddingGemma 300M (download 316MB) and BGE-M3 (download 560MB) with dims/context/size/notes and download buttons">
</p>

Three sources: **Off** (default; no vector embedding at all, pure BM25 keyword
retrieval), **Remote** (bring any OpenAI-compatible `/embeddings` service, selectable
only when the `embedding.*` quartet is configured), **Local** (pick from a built-in
model catalog, ONNX-quantized **CPU inference** — no API key, data never leaves the
machine). The local catalog is a built-in allowlist (each model pinned to a revision
with per-file sha256; arbitrary repos cannot be downloaded).

- **Download**: one click on the model card (default mirror `hf-mirror.com`, resumable
  downloads + sha256 integrity checks; a proxy is used when direct access is
  unreachable — proxy env vars like `HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY` are auto-detected by
  default, see `embedding.proxy`). Per-file failures auto-retry with a rotated cache
  key (`?dshmem-retry=N`, sidestepping occasionally bad CDN cache objects); hash
  mismatches restart from zero, network errors resume from the checkpoint; stored
  under `models/<id>/` in the data directory, deletable from the settings page at any time;
- **On-demand runtime**: the inference runtime (transformers.js, ~100–200MB) is
  installed only on first switch to the local tier, into `runtime/` in the data
  directory — never in the plugin's dependency tree or install directory; model
  loading and inference run on a **dedicated worker thread**, so the host event
  loop is never frozen (conversations and page interactions stay responsive while
  text is being embedded);
- **Live switching**: one click to swap sources — everything is re-embedded in the
  background (visible progress, cancellable; retrieval silently degrades to keywords
  in the meantime, conversations unaffected; a dimension change rebuilds the vector
  table at the new size); a failed switch keeps the old source, which a restart
  still uses;
- **Effective = deployment ceiling AND runtime choice**: `embedding.allowLocalModels=false`
  disables the local tier entirely; without the `embedding.*` quartet the remote tier
  is unavailable (enterprise deployments can lock this down). The choice persists in
  `embedding-source.json`.

## Logging & Troubleshooting

The dsh host prints plugin logs to the console; the plugin mirrors info and above to
`memory.log` in its data directory. The typical log path of one conversation turn:
`L0 capture` → `L0 flush` → `distillation pipeline start` → `LLM call (input/output
chars, duration)` → `L1 extraction done` → `pipeline end`; the next turn shows
`recall hit N L1 records`. Empty LLM output carries full diagnostics (finish reason /
token counts / reasoning excerpt); JSON parse failures include the first 400 characters
of the raw model output; all failure warns carry the first stack frame. The JSONL
fact source is appended per turn and relies on OS write-back (no per-line fsync);
an extreme crash (power loss) loses at most a small tail, and the index DB can be
fully re-derived from the fact source via "Rebuild memories".

## Differences from MemoryCore

- The full pipeline is embedded (no external Gateway); distillation reuses DSH's own LLM;
- L2/L3 changed from "LLM manipulates file tools" to "LLM outputs operation JSON / full documents, engineering side executes";
- Recall injection happens at `agent/pre-step` (message-side synthetic message, the official pre-step replacement semantics) plus agent-scoped `systemPrompt.context` (persona/navigation stable zone — DSH-native events/services);
- Storage/retrieval is a single-machine slimmed version of the official sqlite backend (drops multi-tenant isolation columns, TCVDB cloud backend, audit tables; tokenization uses jieba like the official one — @node-rs/jieba prebuilt binaries union CJK character bigrams: word tokens give BM25 exact-word hits while bigrams keep sub-word recall; on load failure it falls back to pure bigrams, and FTS indexes are rebuilt automatically via a tokenizer version stamp).

The core memory capabilities (layered distillation pipeline, prompt design, and the
dual-write storage architecture) are modeled after **MemoryCore** from

## Roadmap

Features under planning — feedback and priorities welcome in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/JunNanLYS/dsh-layered-memory/issues):

- [ ] **Git branch awareness**: associate memories with the current git branch; recall can filter/boost by branch (orthogonal to the existing memory modes)
- [ ] **Claude Code / Codex memory import**: one-click migration of existing memory assets (`CLAUDE.md`, Claude Code memory files, Codex `AGENTS.md`, etc.), fed into the layered distillation pipeline
