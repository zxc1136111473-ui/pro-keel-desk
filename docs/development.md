# DSH Desktop development guide

This guide covers local development, validation, patch maintenance, and target-native packaging. For the runtime design, see [Architecture](architecture.md). For formal releases, see the [release runbook](release-runbook.md).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or later
- npm
- macOS on Apple Silicon or Intel, or Windows x64

DSH Desktop currently pins `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.2`. Windows packages bundle a target-native Node.js runtime for Harness, while macOS uses an Electron UtilityProcess. Both are independent of the Node.js version used to run development commands.

## Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dataelement/dsh-desktop.git
cd dsh-desktop
npm ci
npm run dev
```

`npm ci` runs the repository's `postinstall` hook. It reapplies the tracked `patch-package` patches, installs DSH brand assets into the pinned Harness frontend, and installs Electron.

Development builds use the separate application name `DSH Desktop Dev` and the separate user-data directory `dsh-desktop-dev`, so they do not reuse production DSH Desktop data. Multiple development worktrees still share that development profile by default; avoid running them at the same time when testing profile, plugin, migration, or recovery changes.

## Validation

Run the core checks before submitting a change:

```bash
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Static checks are not a substitute for runtime verification. Changes that affect startup, profiles, plugins, native dialogs, updates, mobile access, or packaging should also be exercised through the corresponding real application flow.

To exercise the Cloudflare-to-Pinggy fallback without disrupting the machine's network, start the development app with Cloudflare failure simulation enabled:

```bash
DSH_TUNNEL_FORCE_PINGGY=1 npm run dev
```

Then enable the temporary public tunnel from the phone connection screen. The tunnel status should report `pinggy`, and the generated URL should use a Pinggy hostname. This variable affects only the process started from that command; omit it on the next launch to restore the normal Cloudflare-first behavior.

Automatic fallback still happens only when Cloudflare fails to start. If a Cloudflare pairing link is already showing but the phone cannot open it, use **扫码打不开？换一条线路** / **Can't open? Try another link** on the pairing page to switch to Pinggy.

## Maintaining upstream patches

The desktop product intentionally reuses the upstream Harness UI. Desktop-specific provider onboarding, preset transfer, model selection, workspace, branding, and layout changes are captured under `patches/` rather than stored as untracked edits in `node_modules`.

When upgrading Harness:

1. Install the intended upstream version.
2. Verify the current Settings, Credentials, Provider Directory, workspace, and preset contracts.
3. Reapply or rewrite each desktop customization.
4. Regenerate the relevant `patch-package` patches.
5. Run the full automated suite.
6. Start the real app and exercise every affected user flow.

## Packaging

Harness includes architecture-specific native dependencies. Build each installer on the operating system and architecture where it will run.

```bash
# macOS Apple Silicon, on an Apple Silicon Mac or runner
npm run package:mac:arm64

# macOS Intel, on an Intel Mac or runner
npm run package:mac:x64

# Windows x64 NSIS installer, on a Windows x64 machine or runner
npm run package:win
```

Do not invoke `electron-builder --win` from macOS or Linux for a distributable Windows package. The target verification scripts intentionally reject host/target mismatches.

For local unsigned development packages, use the corresponding `package:dev:*` command. Before handing off a Windows installer, verify that `resources/app/node_modules/node/bin/node.exe` exists in `win-unpacked` and require the packaged Windows Harness smoke test to pass.

Formal release artifacts are built, signed, and published by the tag workflow. A local build or pull-request check is not formal release evidence.

## Contribution hygiene

- Never include real API keys in issues, logs, screenshots, fixtures, or test data.
- Preserve unrelated worktree changes.
- Keep temporary research, local reports, and internal working documents under the ignored `doc/` directory.
- Update all localized README files when changing user-visible facts.
