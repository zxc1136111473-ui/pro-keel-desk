 * A cheap signature of how far an install has got.

 * suppress pnpm's progress reporter, so a long copy and a hang look identical
 * from the pipe. The profile's `node_modules` is where the work lands, so its
 * shape is the signal.
 *
 * The walk starts at `node_modules`, not at the virtual store. This profile
 * sets `nodeLinker: hoisted`, so packages land directly under `node_modules`
 * and `.pnpm` holds nothing but a lockfile for the profile's whole life —
 * watching it would report a healthy install as motionless from the first
 * sample to the last. Starting a level up covers the hoisted layout and the
 * isolated one alike, since `.pnpm` is simply one of the entries walked.
 *
 * The shape also has to be sampled below the top level. A directory's mtime
 * moves only when its own entries change, so a package being copied file by
 * file — one package at a time, with child-concurrency pinned to 1 — leaves
 * everything above it untouched for as long as the copy takes. Reading that as
 * a stall would kill a healthy install mid-rename, which is how damaged
 * directories get made in the first place.
 *
 * Symlinks are skipped: pnpm's layout is mostly links into the store, they
 * lead back out of the tree, and none of them is where writing happens. The
 * walk is bounded rather than complete — a truncated walk that shifts between
 * samples reads as progress, which errs toward letting a run continue.
 * @returns a value to compare against the previous sample, never an error.
