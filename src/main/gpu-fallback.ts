 * that after the fact — the switches have to be in place before Chromium
 * boots — so the level that worked is remembered on disk and applied on the
 * next launch.

 * acceleration, on a machine that may only have hiccuped once. So the
 * fallback is deliberately hard to enter and never permanent — see
