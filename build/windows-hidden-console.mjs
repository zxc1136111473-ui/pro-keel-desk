/**
 * Attach a hidden console to the current (console-less) process.
 *
 * The desktop spawns the Harness node process with `detached: true` and
 * `windowsHide: true` (`DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NO_WINDOW` — see
 * `buildHarnessSpawnOptions`), so the Harness itself has no console. On
 * Windows, spawning a console child (pwsh, git, ripgrep, …) from a
 * console-less parent with only `windowsHide` (`CREATE_NO_WINDOW`) still lets
 * the child allocate a fresh, briefly-visible console — the flash reported in
 * issue #233.
 *
 * Giving the Harness its own console and hiding it makes its children inherit
 * a console that is already hidden, so `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` suppresses their
 * windows the same way it does for a console-attached parent. `detached` is
 * left in place, so the #208 Ctrl+C process-group isolation is preserved;
 * `AllocConsole` on a detached process is exactly the escape hatch Microsoft
 * documents for it.
 *
 * @param load - library loader, injectable for tests (defaults to `koffi.load`).
 * @returns true when a console was attached and hidden.
